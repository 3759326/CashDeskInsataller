#  Example IDSHOSTS file.
#
#  IDSHOSTS is a text file that resembles the standard Windows LMHOSTS 
#  specifications.  The file must reside the %SystemRoot%\system32 
#  directory on Windows NT, or %SystemRoot%\system on Windows 95 and 98.
#
#  IDSHOSTS is formated as the following:
#
#  1. All comments must be preceded by #
#  2. The server or drive being mapped has to be the first entry on 
#     a new line.
#  3. One or more spaces must separate the drive or server being 
#     mapped from the IDS server name.
#  4. If the path contains spaces it must be enclosed in double 
#     spaces.
#  5. An optional IDS Database Set name may be specified after the 
#     IDS server name, separated by one or more spaces.  The IDS
#     Database Set name is only used by the Btrieve Win32 Requester.
#  6. Server mappings have to start with two back slashes.
#
#
# j:                   www.pervasive.com       # Drive mapping
# k:\myData\           10.1.1.1                # IP notation can be used
# \\dataServer\public  www.pervasive.com       # Server names need \\
# "m:\my data\"        www.yourserver.com      # If there are spaces in 
#                                              # path the whole path must
#                                              # be enclosed by ""
# l:\accounting        AcctServer     AcctDB   # Example with IDS 
#                                              # Database Set name
